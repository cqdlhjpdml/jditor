  This is your public path.
  If you're running your app at http://example.com and I got your DIST folder right,
  it'll simply be "/dist".
  But if you're running it locally at http://localhost/my/app, it will be "/my/app/dist".

  That means you should probably *not* hardcode that path here but write it to a
  machine-related config file. (If you don't already have something like that,
  google for "dotenv" or something similar.)
